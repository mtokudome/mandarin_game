Mandarin Game

This is a simple static flashcard website.

The website is inspired by the wonderful language learning website www.babadum.com

I am not (yet) a programmer, but I wanted to understand how to make a simple version. So I paid a developer on Fiverr to help me write the Javascript code for me.

From there, I have tweaked a little with the look and feel.
